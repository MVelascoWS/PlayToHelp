Chainsafe’s open source tools will make it possible to connect blockhain to game.

The metadata storage is supported by IPFS.

With Polygon’s technologyvv we deployed smart contracts that will allow decentralizing resources for students. 

Using Push, scholarship winners will be notified that they have been awarded and will be displayed in their wallet.

The distribution of student scholarships  will be transmit blockchain assets according to predefined rules, with a single transaction using Superfluid.
